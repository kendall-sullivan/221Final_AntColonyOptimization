# 221 Final - Ant Colony Optimization
## Final Project for COMP 221 - Implementation of Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm

This implementation is based on the pseudocode from our report. We used the Adjacency List implementation from the COMP 128 graph implementation activity as a basis for our graph data structure, but we modified it to use the new Edge class that we wrote. This class takes in vertices from the adjacency list and makes edge objects between them which can have weights and pheromone levels. In order to implement our pseudocode in Java, we had to use data structures such as HashMaps, Lists, and the Bag data structure that is part of the 128 graph. Due to this, there were times when we had to add extra for-loops or helper functions not part of the pseudocode in order for it to work with Java, so this may lead to a sub-optimal time complexity for our implementation.
